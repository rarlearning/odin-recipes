    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Turn your instant pot to sauté and add the bacon.</li>
        <li> Cook until crisp, stirring often to cook evenly.</li>
        <li> Remove the bacon to a paper towel lined plate.</li>
        <li> Add the onions and peppers and cook until tender.</li>
        <li> Add the meat and cook until browned.</li>
        <li> Drain off any excess grease, we just tilt the pot and use a large spoon.</li>
        <li> Add all of the remaining ingredients and 3/4 of the bacon and stir to combine.</li>
        <li> Turn the instant pot to chili (if you don't have a "chili" setting, use the "manual" setting) and cook for 18-20 minutes*. Allow pressure to release for 10-15 minutes or quick release with the vent.</li>
        <li> Serve with limes, sour cream, cheese, and a little bacon!</li>
